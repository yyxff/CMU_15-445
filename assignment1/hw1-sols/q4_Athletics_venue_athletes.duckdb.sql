-- For all venues that have hosted `Athletics` discipline competitions, list all athletes who have competed
-- at these venues, and sort them by the distance from their nationality country to the country they 
-- represented in descending order, then by name alphabetically.
--
-- Details: The athletes can have any discipline and can compete as a team member or an individual in these
-- venues. The distance between two countries is calculated as the sum square of the difference between their
-- latitudes and longitudes. Only output athletes who have valid information. (i.e., the athletes appear in
-- the athletes table and have non-null latitudes and longitudes for both countries.) Assume that if a team
-- participates in a competition, all team members are competing.
-- Output Format: ATHLETE_NAME|REPRESENTED_COUNTRY_CODE|NATIONALITY_COUNTRY_CODE
